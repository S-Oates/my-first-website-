# My Very First Web Page

Welcome to my very first website!

I constructed the site as part of the learning material for the Fullstack Web Developer program at Code Institute. 

You can browse the website [here](https://sjoates28.github.io/my-first-website-/)!

## Project Description 

This website was created as a means to familiarize myself with the operation of common development tools such as Git, GitHub and Cloud9 and to gain perspective on how these tools are used effectively to write and manage code. Displayed in this project is a breakdown of the various tehcnologies used across different sections of the program. 

## Technology 

This project was written in both HTML and CSS using Cloud9, deployed via Git and currently hosted on GitHub pages.
