# My Very First Web Page

Welcome to my very first website!

I constructed the site as part of the learning material for the Fullstack Web Developer program at Code Institute. 

You can browse the website [here](https://sjoates28.github.io/my-first-website-/)!

## Project Description 

This website was created as a means to familiarize myself with the functions and operation of common development tools such as _Git_, _GitHub_ and _Cloud9_ and to gain perspective on how these tools are used effectively to write and manage code. Displayed in this project is a breakdown of the various tehcnologies used across each of the different sections of the program. The site consists of three pages: **Stream One**, **Stream Two** and **Stream Three**. Each page consists of 6 logos with individual links to descriptors of the relevant technologies covered in the program. 

## Technology 

This project was written in both _HTML 5_ and _CSS 3_ using _Cloud9_, deployed via _Git_ and currently hosted on _GitHub pages_. 

#### *HTML 5*
HTML stands for **H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage which is a standard markup language used for creating the structure of web pages and web appliations.**Markup** indicates how a file should be displayed following the insertion of a sequence of characters and/or symbols at certian places in a file. For instance, _HTML_ contributed to  idividually linking each image from its source to my site to create the look of the logo's. Each logo consists of an interactive heading below it titled with its respective name, which possesses a link directing the user to a wikipedia page with information pertaining to that technology. 

#### *CSS 3*

#### *Cloud9*

#### *Git*

#### *GitHub*
